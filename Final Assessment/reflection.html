                Responsive design is considered good design.  Responsive design is when a webpage can adapt and change it's layout 
                depending on what device the user is accessing the webpage with.  This is important in the modern age because there 
                are hundreds of devices that are accessing the internet and accessing information online.  As as developer, it is 
                important to cater to the different users so that they have an optimal experience navigating your website.
                <br><br>
                Things to consider when creating a responsive design is the users screen size, platform and orientation.  A developer
                can intelligently manipulate the webpage using CSS media queries along with the use of flexible grids and layouts.
                The concept of having a responsive design is to make sure that the webpage automatically takes these factors into 
                consideration.  That means no matter what new device or new screen resolution monitor is relased, the webpage will still 
                show the information needed in a clean and predictable manner.
                <br><br>
                If a webpage is designed correctly, it can take the dimensions of the screen display the data in a format that shows 
                webpage in a presentable manner.  Often many web pages do not implement repsonsive design properly or at all.  In the 
                age of cell phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phablets, this translates to having poor web browsing experiences
                by the user.  
                <br><br>
                Some website will create a dedicated version of the website for mobile platforms or tablets.  This is costly because
                and mostly a web developer will need to create another set of code to update and maintain.  It is also unnecessary, as
                long as long as a responsive design has been implemented properly.  This is why it is important to think carefully about
                the design of the website before coding and implementing the webpage.  
                <br><br>
                Throughtout this course, I have learned how to code in Javascript, use DOM, create different design layouts using HTML, and 
                add style to the layouts using CSS.  I have learned how to parse and verify data forms and send post and get requests.
                I have also learned how to parse JSON files for data as well as embed images, audio, and video into a webpage.
